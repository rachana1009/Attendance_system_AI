# Automatic Attendance System
Automatic Attendance System is designed to collect and manage studentâ€™s attendance records from video camera devices installed in a class rooms. Based on the verification of student identification in the video cameras, attendance will be updated in data base. Attendance will be taken in every class at particular interval of time.
# Detection
Detection is done by the help of OpenCV and Haar cascades

Face detection using Haar cascades is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained with a set of input data. OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smiles, etc.. Today we will be using the face classifier. You can experiment with other classifiers as well.

## Motivation
The motivation for pursuing the project of an Automated Attendance System using Facial Recognition is to modernize and streamline the attendance tracking process in educational and professional settings. Traditional methods are inefficient and error-prone, taking up valuable time and resources. By leveraging facial recognition technology, we aim to make attendance management more efficient, accurate, and secure.
